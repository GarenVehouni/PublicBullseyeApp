# PublicBullseyeApp

A fully functioning app created on Xcode using SwiftUI programming language

This app randomly generates a number from 1 - 100 and requires a user to slide a touch bar with ranges 1 - 100 in the attempt to match the distance to the randomly generated number

After the user hits the "hit me" button, a pop-up generates indicating how far they are from the target
